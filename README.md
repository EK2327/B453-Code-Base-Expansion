# Code Bade Expansion:
This repository represents the first "code base expansion" project for CSCI-B453 Game Development.
I am expanding upon the code base provided for the game Dualikiwi developed for the Global Game Jam 2022.

I am expanding on the original game by adding a new interactable item that "mirrors" the direction the enemy kiwi moves, causing its movement to match the player controlled kiwi rather than move opposite it. This effect will occur when either kiwi interacts with a mirror interactable and will be undone if either kiwi interacts with another mirror interactable wihtin the same level. This effect will only last until the level is cleared or the player kiwi is defeated and the level is reset.

The mirror interactable has been added to levels 1 and 5. As well as in the new levels 16 and 17, which are designed specifically to make use of the mirror's properties.
